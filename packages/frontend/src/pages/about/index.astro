                    How's it going, I'm Greg, self-taught
                    <strong>Web Development Generalist</strong>
                    with experience in technical communication. I like cycling around

                    about new tech extremely fulfilling, I can't help but brag
                    to my friends and colleauges about my toy projects.

                    Life hits hard, and coding was my light. It kept me
                    grounded, creative and oriented. The little dopamine hits I
                    get when I'm able to solve tiny problems is so pleasing, I'm
                    nothing if not in-love with the process of slowly building
                    systems.

                    <h3>What's next for me</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before I found my way into web development, I spent
                        longer than I’d like feeling stuck and uncertain about
                        my direction. That time ultimately helped clarify what I
                        truly wanted to pursue. But let's be honest, this
                        post-pandemic scene isn't really as friendly to
                        new-comers at the moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, I definitely will not be stopping, it's
                        different when you actually found something you realize
                        you can probably do until you retire. I'm no stranger to
                        comments like <em
                            >"when are you gonna stop with that website stuff"</em
                        > or <em
                            >"when are you planning on stopping to focus on
                            stuff that matters?"</em
                        >
                        <strong>This is what matters!</strong> So While I recognize
                        the importance of finding a job, its less important than
                        just being able to write code and solve problems, which I
                        can do independently and without external incentives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm glad I found programming and web development, and I
                        will keep going no matter what it takes.

                        I'm not really a big fan of Steve Jobs, but this quote
                        resonated with me. It took me a bit of time to start
                        showcasing my projects because I hadn’t yet found a web
                        framework that felt like the right fit, until recently.

                                feel straightforward.

                            these tools, I don't know how enjoyable my developer
                            experience would be. I acknowledge that that my
