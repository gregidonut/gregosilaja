# [gregosilaja][1]

Well I probably need a gregosilaja so here we go. I want this to host both
the portfolio and just my main thoughts about piercing into the industry
even though I'm not really into showcasing my life. Unavoidable at this
day and age I guess.

Currently hosted at [https://gregosilaja.cc][1]

## todos

- [ ] add dynamic quotes(i'm sure there's some api that does this free, LLMs are a waste of electricity)
- [ ] add an endpoint that contains markdown content for the blog.
- [ ] animations for the tech logos
- [ ] a nav section when clicking on the hamburger icon responsive when screensize is larger, in which case a `nav bar + footer` replaces it
- [ ] overall just responsive design for larger screens
- [ ] probably needs better component management
